title: Module 6&#58; Activate the Process

Now that we have created this process, it needs to be activated in order to evaluate new Trip Request records. 
After you activate a process, you can no longer edit that process. However, you can click Clone to save the process as a new inactive process.
You can’t activate a process unless it has:

1. At least one defined criteria node
2. At least one defined immediate or scheduled action


##Activate The Process

1. In the upper right hand corner of your Process Builder screen, Click **Activate**.



If you activate a version of a process that already has an active version, the previously active version is automatically deactivated. To see that version later, refer to the process’s version history.
After you’ve activated your process, consider creating or editing test records that will start the process to make sure it’s working correctly. If you do, remember to delete those test records or return them to their previous values once you’ve confirmed that your process works as designed.
If you later want Salesforce to stop using a process to evaluate records as they’re created or edited, open the active process and click Deactivate.
