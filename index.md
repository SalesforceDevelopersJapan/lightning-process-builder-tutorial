title: Salesforce Lightning Process Builder Tutorial
---
The Salesforce1 Lightning Process Builder is a new workflow tool that helps anyone in your company quickly and easily automate business processes such as employee onboarding, and new customer onboarding - all without writing a single line of code. Creating new processes through a point and click interface helps you avoid repetitive time-consuming tasks so you can do more and go faster.


In this tutorial, you use the Lightning Process Builder to build process used to manage a trip approval business process. The process automates multiple notifications and calendar updates triggered by a trip request.
The process uses an installed custom object with related action to automate a business process.
